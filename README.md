# Cybersecurity
It's no secret that Cybersecurity is a trending subject. The subject has always peaked my interest.


## Presentations
I am a member of the [UofSC's Cybersecurity Club](https://usccyber.org). Here I occasionally deliver informative presentations to the club on topics in security.

#### File Carving
* I presented to the UofSC Cybersecurity club on April 11th, 2019 about the File Carving data recovery technique. Carving a JPG image from a word document is elementary in comparison to mass data recovery for investigations. This presentation was not created for this purpuse though; rather, I wanted to demonstrate the concept of [Magic Numbers](https://asecuritysite.com/forensics/magic) and file formats for data recovery. 

#### Kali Linux
* On October 8th, 2019, I presented to the UofSC Army ROTC's Cyber cadets. I met with the Cyber XO to discuss the presentation, then decided to deliver information on the [Kali Linux](kali.org) operataing system. This operating system comes with toolkits for post-exploitation, network mapping and reconaissance, digital forensics, packet sniffing, and more cybersecurity-related needs. I wanted the Army Cyber cadets to have an awareness of why this operating system is important and how it can be used.


## Bro
* I attended a workshop on the [Bro IDS](https://www.bro.org) at B-Sides Charelston in 2018. All workshop materials were given by Andrew Beard.

## Port Scanning
* In late 2018, I attended a workshop for Network Penetration Testing. This workshop was presented by Barrett Adams and Chris Myers from [Ubeeri](https://www.ubeeri.com/). 

The workshop allowed the attendees to fully exploit a simulated vulnerability in an Apache Tomcat web server. The following steps were taken:
1. Performed reconnaisance by scanning ports the ports of common services on the servers.
2. Used [Metasploit's](https://www.metasploit.com/) auxillary module to check services for default credentials and establish a foothold in the web server.
3. Used [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) (now unsupported) as a command and control (C2) framework. It helped to deploy HTTP listeners and a Powershell launcher.
