# Cybersecurity
It's no secret that Cybersecurity is a trending subject. The subject has always peaked my interest.


## Presentations
* I am a member of the [UofSC's Cybersecurity Club](https://usccyber.org). Here I occasionally deliver informative presentations to the club on topics in security.

#### File Carving
* I presented to the UofSC Cybersecurity club on April 11th, 2019 about the File Carving data recovery technique. Carving a JPG image from a word document is elementary in comparison to mass data recovery for investigations. This presentation was not created for this purpuse though; rather, I wanted to demonstrate the concept of [Magic Numbers](https://asecuritysite.com/forensics/magic) and file formats for data recovery. 


## Bro
* I attended a workshop on the [Bro IDS](https://www.bro.org) at B-Sides Charelston in 2018. All workshop materials were given by Andrew Beard.
